Welcome to Lose and Gain!
This repo has been created to help people set themselves up for success according to their weight management goals.
The author of this repo began studying weight gain and loss in December of 2017 and over the course of the past year
has accumelated knowledge that he feels can be helpful to people who want to know how to define their goals, and how to follow through. Without any futher ado, let's begin!

## Assessing where you are right now

The first step in the journey of fitness is understanding where you are begining from. You can compare following through on a fitness goal as dedicating a period of time to prepare for long-term travel.
1. You need to assess your current status (Work, schedule, money, commitments)
2. Understand what you need to do to prepare for this trip (update commitments, modify your schedule, save money)
3. Start following through to get where you want to be.

**How to assess (If my goal is weight loss)?**

1. Weigh yourself
2. Set a target weight
3. Find out the macro-nutrient breakdown and calorie count you will need to hit daily. 
4. Download My Fitness Pal 
  - This is how you will track all of your macro nutrients and help you to make better decisions to stick within the ranges you need to be in. 

## Figure out what you need to eat to stay within those ranges.
Some information has been sourced from From (https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/How-Calculate-Macros-44890781)

Macro Nutrients: Protein, Carbs, Fat. These are the building blocks of the foods you are eating, and each have a different caloric value. 
    <br>```1 gram of protien === 4 calories```
    <br>```1 gram of carbohydrates === 4 calories```
    <br>```1 gram of fat === 9 calories```


## Rules to self-calculating your macros
1. **Determine maintenance calories:** <br>"This is the number of calories you need to maintain bodyweight. You can determine it by multiplying bodyweight (lbs) by 14 to 15."
2. **Set deficit/surplus calories:** "If your goal is fat loss, a good place to start is by subtracting 500 from Step One.
3. **Set protein:** You should be eating 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight. That will give you your protein in grams per day. If you are trying to aim for a target weight, you can alternatively set the number of grams of protien to your target body weight).
4. **Set fat:** Multiply your bodyweight (lbs) by 0.3.
5. **Set carbs:** Divide your remaining calories by four.
6. **Make adjustments:** "This step is not necessary, but if you prefer one macronutrient to another, or want more or fewer calories, then this step is the time to adjust."
**Calories:** If you want to gain or lose weight, calories are the thing you need to focus on most. If you want to lose weight, you need to be eating in a calorie deficit. If you are sticking to you diet and not losing weight, you are eating too many calories. If you want to gain weight but can't, you are not eating enough calories. It's that simple.

Why is protien king when it comes to defining what you eat? 2 reasons:
1. Protein helps your muscles recover from the microtears in your muscles caused by physical exercise. 
2. It has a low calorie count compared to fat, allowing you to eat more, get more nutrition, without building too much fat.

Therefore, your protein count essentially becomes the cornerstone of your macronutrient breakdown. A general rule of thumb is to set the number of grams of protein you plan to eat to either your current weight or your target weight if you are trying to lose weight.
You can then set the number of grams of fat and carbs that you eat to your preference so you fall within the correct calorie range.
*Consider that a single gram of carbohydrates === 4 calories, while a single gram of fat === 9 calories. If you like to eat more, you can do so with a high-carb, low-fat diet. 
Now I am not advocating for any particular breakdown of macro-nutrients. Obviously there are other factors that come into play with regards to how the body processes these nutrients, and many research studies that show the benefits of one particular macro-nutrient breakdown over another (low carb high fat diets like Ketogentic diet for example). The author is simply showing, purely from a mathematical perspective, how someone can adjust their diet to their own personal preference. You are **heavily encouraged** to read more about how eating affects the body on your own. Just remember that the quick and dirty rule of thumb is set the number of grams of protein to your target weight, and breakdown the rest as you please. This will at least get the ball rolling and get you closer to your goal weight.


Here is a sample case study, let's say you are a man in your early 30s that weighs 220 pounds and does not regularyly exercise. Your target weight is 190 pounds.
```Daily calories === 3080 || 2580 to lose weight``` (220 x 14)
```Daily grams of protein === 190 grams || 760 calories``` (Number of grams per pound of body weight)
```Daily grams of fat === 66 grams || 594 calories``` (220 x 0.3)
```Daily grams of carbohydrates === 306.5 grams``` (2580 - 760 - 594 = 1226 | 1226 / 4 = 306.5)

## Set expectations
  - This is a major lifestyle change. You may mess up a few times. I myself fall off the horse from time to time. It happens. Get back up on the horse and keep at it.
  - Realize that if you are losing weight, there are times you will be hungry. Your body needs to adjust to a lowered calorie intake. Right now if you eat every time you are hungry, your body and mind are used to being satisfied every time the desire to eat presents itself. When you start exercising control over that urge, it will not be easy at first. You are going to be hungry. It's going to happen, but like all things it will pass. After a few times, you will be fine. As long as you are eating within your macro nutrient breakdown, you should be fine. 
## Side notes
  - The author eats essentailly the same thing every day. He found a breakfast that he likes, a lunch that he likes, and a dinner that he likes. He often orders those meals and has them delivered. He also supplements with protein powder to ensure he is hitting the cornerstone macro nutrient goals.
  - The author strongly believes that eliminating variety while you are learning how to think and eat in terms of macro-nutrients makes it easier to stay consistent. You don't have to overthink or wonder. You know what works and go with it. If you deviate from the diet, you know exactly where the deviations are and know how to get back on track.
  - Eating the same thing is not for everyone. Some people need variety. If you need variety, realize that you will need to dedicate more time to creating a diet that changes regularly and still has the appropriate macro-nutrient breakdown and calorie count for your goals.

He highly recommends that you go through it at your own pace, and try to make it a habit it read over a new section of the wiki as often as possible.
